    <h1>Renaissance</h1>
    <p>The Renaissance (from French Renaissance, meaning "rebirth"; Italian: Rinascimento, from re&ndash; "again" and nascere "be born") was a cultural movement that spanned roughly the 14th to the 17th century, beginning in Italy in the Late Middle Ages and later spreading to the rest of Europe. The term is also used more loosely to refer to the historic era, but since the changes of the Renaissance were not uniform across Europe, this is a general use of the term.</p>
